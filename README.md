# Provider Pattern Application

## 1. So... What is this?

The idea of this simple repository is to show the implementation of the "Provider" pattern through a basic React application. In this way we can clearly exemplify the use of **this pattern against the problem of Props Drilling Hell**.

## 2. Ok... So, how do I check the differences?

To see the code structure of an application that is affected by Props Drilling Hell you can visit the `whitout-provider-pattern` branch, and to see the comparative difference after implementing the use of the pattern you can visit the `with-provider-pattern` o `master` branch.

The code has been structured in a very simple way, the use of `context` can be improved through the creation of a Hook, however for our purposes the written code is more than enough.

## 3. Anything else?
- All constructive criticisms are very well received, you can send them to me at julio.zaravia.dev@gmail.com.
- If you're going to criticize this project in an offensive way, please don't do it, remember that no one comes to this world knowing everything.
- If you want to improve the code, you're free to do so, just let me know what you changed or improved so I can learn from you.
- That's it, I really liked learning from this little project, if you took the time to read this, you're a good person and I wish you a good day.
